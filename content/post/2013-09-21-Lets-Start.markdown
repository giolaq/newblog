Let’s start this new adventure in blogger-land with a series of post about [Algorithms][algowiki] and Go.
I choose this two characters because of two targets, to learn a new language ( [Go][golang] ) and renew my neurons about the classic algorithms studied in the past; I want to mix an old ingredient with a new one. I’m sure this road could take me to perceive new approaches to common problems, and i’m sure this trip is going to be funny.
So…Let’s start!
